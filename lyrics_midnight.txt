Oh, Suzanna
I hope you're happy now
I see you flexing on the gram with your sponsor
Suzanna
I hope your happy now
I see you change your skin colour
And your hair is longer now
Nakuona Paris
Hapo kando ya Champs-Élysées
Ukitesa na kamini ye-ye-ye-ye-ye
Non of my business
And I see you in London
Silicon on your bum bum
Shaking what your doctor gave ya
On your worst behaviour
Suzanna bhane
Senje

If you get to hear this song
Somebody loves you
Suzanna bhane
Senje
Halo, halo, halo (halo, halo, halo)
Change your mind and come back home
Somebody loves you, yeah

Mwanamke tabia
Shepu ni majaliwa
Ila wengi walinyimwa tabia
Na shepu kabarikiwa
Mwanaume hisia
Pesa ni majaliwa
Ila wengi walinyimwa hisia
Na pesa kabarikiwa
Nakuona Brazil
Hapo Rio de Janeiro, eh
Ukiongezewa nywele, senje
None of my business
And I see you in China
With the latest designer
Shaking what your doctor gave you
On your worst behaviour
Suzanna bhane
Senje
Halo, halo, halo (halo)

Senje

Senje
Halo halo halo
Change your mind and come back home
Somebody loves you

"Midnight Train"

Steady rocking on the midnight train
Steady rocking on the midnight train
Oh, Lord, steady rocking on the midnight train
To Zion, to Zion

Hii maisha ni safari
Tunapita kama moshi
Na kabla tuzame mchangani
Kuna kushinda na kufeli oh
Inabidi ujijue tofauti ya mwalimu na mwanafunzi
Ni ujuzi na ujuaji

Oh it's unbelievable
That we make it this far
Undeniable
We see the promised land from afar
And it's so beautiful
No they can't touch the fire
And you know it's not in vain
We steady tripping through the pain

Steady rocking on the midnight train
Steady rocking on the midnight train
Oh, Lord, steady rocking on the midnight train
To Zion, to Zion

Siku zazidi badilika
Mengi Yazidi kunipita jama oh no
Maji yalipozidi unga
Hawakudhani tutafika fika

It's unbelievable
That we made it this far
Undeniable
To see the promised land from afar
So beautiful
They gon' know who we are
Keep on walking in the rain
Kuna blessings in the pain

It's a narrow road to Zion
Nothing will ever deny us
Whatever it takes keep on walking
Whatever it takes keep on moving
To Zion, to Zion, to Zion

She's so insecure, she don't make love with the lights on
So insecure, she don't wanna talk about it no
And I'm so insecure one day she'll leave me
And she'll find another guy
Who makes her happier than I

Juu nikiwa maji
Mi ni chizi
Mi ni stalker
Nakuhallaa
When you're naked, I see angels
And I hope, you see the same

You're insecure (eeeeeh)
I'm insecure (aaaaaah)
Oh, baby, you're so insecure (eeeeeh)
I'm insecure (aaaaaah)

I'm so insecure, mi husomanga message ukiniachia phone
I'm so insecure, I'm never telling you about it, yeah
Mi huenda swimmo na T-sho
And you never leave the house with no make-up on
But let's not talk about it, yeah-yeah

Chini ya maji, si ni machizi
Twachunguzana kipolisi
And your body is a movie
And I hope you feel the same

But you're insecure (eeeeeh)
Woman you're insecure (aaaaaah)
Woman you're insecure (eeeeeh)
And I'm insecure (aaaaaah)

Why are we still so insecure
Don't know what we're running from
And I'm breaking, but before we crash and burn
Hope we see the light, I hope we see the light

Chini ya maji, si ni machizi
Twachunguzana kipolisi
And your body is a movie
And I hope you feel the same
Chini ya maji, si ni machizi
Twachunguzana kipolisi
And your body is a movie
And I hope you feel the same


"Feel My Love"

She says she's ok I don't believe her
There's just something 'bout the way
She turned her back on me
I know in my mind
I'll never leave her
There's just something 'bout the way
We love each other right

And even though we fight all night and day
I know sometimes in love there can be pain
And even though we need a little break
I know that you'll come back to me
You know that I'll come back to you

Cos that's when you start to feel my love
Feel it, that's when you feel it
That's when you start to feel my love
Feel it, that's when you feel it

Usiponipenda ntapendwa na nani
Nitakua mgeni wa nani
Ukiwa mbali nami nabaki taabani
Mbona nahisi kisirani yawa
Haina maana mi na wewe kuzozana
Mbona tunasimangana
Hatuwezi semezana my love
Haina maana mi na wewe kuzozana
Mbona tunasimangana
Hatuwezi semezana

Cos that's when you start to feel my love
Feel it, that's when you feel it
That's when you start to feel my love
Feel it, that's when you feel it

And even if we fight all night and day
I know sometimes in love there can be pain
And even if we need a little break
I know that you'll come back to me
You know that I'll come back to you
Cos that's when you start to feel my love

"Brighter Days"
(feat. Soweto Gospel Choir)

Cos I'm certain brighter days are yet to come
Ain't no question that tomorrow there'll be good times (good times)
I believe with every beat of my heart

I'm on a one way train
Tenda mema nenda zangu do my best
Saa zingine huwaga ni noma (huwaga ni noma)
Imani yangu inanichoma but I know there'll be a better day, yeah
I'm living on the edge, sijui nitashukia kwa gani stage
Life inanisunda kwa corner (sunda kwa corner)
Emotionally niko kwa border, I pray, I pray for better days

Siku zikizidi
Nazidi makinika zaidi
I'm holding on a little bit longer (a little bit longer)
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
I see I see a better day (ngiyabona)
Visions of love, from up above, the sun is not too far away
Nawasha taa, naona far, I know I will be ok
Reach for the stars with everything in my heart
I know I know I know I know


There's gonna be days like this (kulezi zinsuku)
We need to be stronger (qina)
Misukosuko na mahangaiko
Ni hali ya dunia mungu yupo
And on days like this (days like this)
We need to rise up (rise up)
Wakijaribu kutuzika tutagerminate
Our lives will never be the same

(Ngiyakholwa, ngiyakholwa) yebo ngiyakholwa
(Ngiyakholwa, ngiyakholwa)
I believe with every beat of my heart
I believe with every beat of my heart

"Wake Up"
(feat. Mortimer)

Put my feet in the water
These are the days we used to pray for
You're all I have
You're everything I have to live for
Oh this is heaven
Sometimes we forget to be grateful
I count my blessings
You are my blessing

You could have been anywhere in the world
But you're here with me
Let's live it all tonight
Kesho si guarantee
Life has no warranty
Are you ready? (I'm ready)
Are you ready now now now

I'll give my soul for the gardening
A piece of me is my offering
Got to swim when you've been thrown into
Deepest ends. Pay attention, listen
This is how you achieve direction
Live it how you imagine it
Play with the fire a little bit
It never burns when you're used to it
Sometimes we'll wish we could fly away
And there'll be times when we need to stay

Are you willing, are you ready
Willing are you ready
Willing are you ready
Willing willing
Are you willing, are you ready
Willing are you ready
Willing are you ready
Willing willing

No better place than the mountains peace and quiet
Whispers a flowing river I can hear
Sounds of the wind of soul cause kneeling giants
Life has a way of showing sense of humor

Let love and soul transpire
Give thanks embrace your fire
All glory to messiah
Follow your heart don't tire

Want to be loved, want to feel love
Want to be loved, want to feel love

"Rhumba Japani"
(feat. Kaskazini, Bensoul, Xenia, Nviiri the Storyteller, Okello Max & nhp)

Kuna rhumba ya Juja
Na ni ya maboy
Ukisaka mitumba
Enda rhumba ya Toi
Kuna rhumba ya Kibich
Utajua hujui
Kuna rhumba for all you niggas
Ila rhumba Japani ndio rhumba

Kuna rhumba ya state house
Iko chini ya maji
Kuna rhumba ya bunge
Ya majambazi
Ukileta ujinga
Utalala ndani
Kuna rhumba for all you niggas
Lakini rhumba Japani ndio rhumba

Hapa ni wapi, tumezungukwa na shisha
Na shashamani, mapochopocho na vinywaji
Mbali mbali, wengine wanatapika
Wakizirai

Hapa ni wapi, wanatutwanga mapicha
Kipaparazi, tumezungukwa na warembo
Geti kali, tunazitoka na style
Za kizamani

Kuna rhumba ya Westy
Ya mabeshte
Wa mashinani
Sheki your waiste
Rhumba ni nyepesi
Isikue kesi
Kuna rhumba for all my niggas
Ila rhumba Japani ndio rhumba

Kuna rhumba Karura
Ya kupanda miti
Ukiwa Koinange
Hakunaga risiti
Rhumba Oyole
Hio ni ya mangwati
All of my hoes and all of my niggas
Rhumba Japani ndio rhumba

Hapa ni wapi, tumezungukwa na mabouncer
Kama chwani, kuna mapedi mapoko
Pia mapinji, na wanaseti Michele
Kwenye vinywaji

Hapa ni wapi, kuna visanga vioja
Mahakamani, wapenzi wapigana
Mate hadharani, wengine wanatekana
Nyuma ya taxi

Nitie rhumba obunga
Mano mar jothurwa
To kidwa bilo mbuta
Rieri yo manyata
Yawuoi orwaka akala
To nyiwa ondiso avunja
Kuna rhumba for all you niggas
Lakini rhumba Japani ndio rhumba

Aaaaaaah
Sol Generation you know
Hii shit imeniweka zone, inatamba

Hapa ni wapi, waheshimiwa wako nje
Kwa foleni, na raia wako ndani
Wajivinjari, wanazitoka na style
Ni za kiodi

Hapa ni wapi, mawochi wote wameleta
Utiaji, wakafungia wakubwa
Nje ya party, wakawachia ofisi
Wafanyikazi

"Sober"

When I get sober
I'll get my act together
I will put my life in order
No longer be a victim
Of the devil on my shoulder
Lord knows I've been lost for way too long
I'm getting older
Na muda unayoyoma aisee


Call my mama
And tell her that I'm sorry for the lies and pain I caused her
And tell her that I never meant to turn out like my father
Lord knows that she's cried too many tears for all my drama
Naomba unisamehe mathe

Niko maji, niko maji, niko maji, niko maji
Niko maji, niko maji, niko maji, niko maji

I call my daughter
Listen to the stories of a guy that she called father
Hope I get the courage to say sorry to her mother
Lord knows that she tried to make it work I pray the karma
The karma will be easy on me

When I get sober
I'll look for all my friends and make amends
I'll drink more water
Find somebody new to love again
Feels like it's over
But Lord knows that I need another chance
To start all over
Na Misri sirudi kamwe

When I get sober
I'll get my act together
I will put my life in order
No longer be a victim
Of the devil on my shoulder
Lord knows I've been lost for way too long
I'm getting older
Na muda unayoyoma aisee

"My Everything"

And I know you are, I know you are
